### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhayshaw1601/Mood-Music-generator.git
   cd Mood-Music-generator
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your `.env` file:**
   Create a file named `.env` in the root folder with your Spotify credentials:

   ```
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
   ```

### Running the App

Run the Flask server:

```bash
python main.py
```

Visit **[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)** in your browser to access the UI, input your mood, and get song recommendations.

### How It Works

1. **User input**: Type in a mood description.
2. **Sentiment analysis**: NLTK VADER determines if you're *happy*, *sad*, or *neutral*.
3. **Spotify search**: Fetches matching tracks programmatically.
4. **YouTube links**: Generates clickable links for free music playback.
5. **Language filter** (optional): Search is refined by adding the chosen language keyword.

### Customization Ideas

* Improve mood detection using advanced NLP (e.g., transformers)
* Add more mood categories (energetic, relaxed, etc.)
* Integrate with Spotify OAuth to **play music inside the app**
* Let users save their favorite songs (session-based playlists)
* Add UI enhancements like Dark Mode or a slider-based mood picker
